Welcome to OpenVINO™ portal in openEuler, OpenVINO™ is an open-source software toolkit for optimizing and deploying deep learning models.

- **Inference Optimization**: Boost deep learning performance in computer vision, automatic speech recognition, generative AI, natural language processing with large and small language models, and many other common tasks.
- **Flexible Model Support**: Use models trained with popular frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, Keras, and PaddlePaddle. Convert and deploy models without original frameworks.
- **Broad Platform Compatibility**: Reduce resource demands and efficiently deploy on a range of platforms from edge to cloud. OpenVINO™ supports inference on CPU (x86, ARM), GPU (OpenCL capable, integrated and discrete) and AI accelerators (Intel NPU).
- **Community and Ecosystem**: Join an active community contributing to the enhancement of deep learning performance across various domains.
